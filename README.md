## Introduction

Now-a-days, it has become a big challenge for businesses to automate the process of extracting the key details from the invoices since they receive invoices in various formats. Raw text can be extracted from the images by using traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques, but the big deal is to understand and structure the data. The goal of our project is to use a SLM (Small Language Model) which integrates with the OCR to enhance the invoice processing. The SLM will be built in such a way that it helps in structuring the extracted text, identifying key details and reduce manual effort in financial data processing. 

## Problem Statement

Traditional OCR systems are used to extract text from different invoices, but they often fail to effectively understand the context and structure of the data. This leads to difficulty in identifying key fields (e.g., invoice number, total amount, dates, etc.,). These may be some other issues as well such as errors in misclassified text and lack of semantic understanding due to different invoice layouts. 

To solve this, we propose a hybrid approach using:
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction
A Small Language Model (SLM) for key field extraction and intelligent structuring. 

By applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), our model will be able to automatically detect, classify and extract relevant invoice details, improving efficiency and reducing errors in financial workflows.
